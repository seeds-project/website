## Stakeholder-Based Environmentally-Sustainable and Economically Doable Scenarios for the Energy Transition

Decision support tools for environmental sustainability need to contend with the issue that it is individuals and the organizations they are part of that make decisions towards sustainability; this always entails trade-offs between social, economic, political, and environmental concerns. Furthermore, different individuals and organizations disagree on the importance of these different factors. Due to the urgency of the energy transition to preserve a livable global climate, realistic transition scenarios that integrate consideration of these trade-offs are needed. However, current energy-environmental modelling methods are unable to do this with sufficient speed and quality. Our long-term vision is to address this by developing novel computational approaches that include the preferences of real-world stakeholders directly in the computer models providing decision support. To do so, we combine energy and environmental scientific software development with the development and trialing of a web application that makes a "human-computer loop" possible.

In the SEEDS project a [consortium of four European institutions](/about/#partners-and-contacts) is building an approach to integrate humans into energy transition scenario design, while accurately modelling the relevant technical, economic and environmental constraints. We do this for several case studies in Portugal. The three-year project runs from March 2021 to February 2024.
