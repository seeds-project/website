## Stakeholder-Based Environmentally-Sustainable and Economically Doable Scenarios for the Energy Transition

The urgency to cut energy-related greenhouse gas emissions is recognized by EU policy. Efforts to do so, however, are hindered by the limitations of software used to generate and assess national energy transition scenarios. These tools generally overlook social issues and environmental sustainability in favor of a techno-economic worldview, where an optimal solution is determined by cost minimization. Yet, when it comes to the practical on-the-ground implementation of such scenarios, real-world concerns come to the forefront. Such concerns are both environmental (e.g., land and resource use) and social (e.g., what trade-offs are important to local stakeholders). No workable solutions to integrate both of these into techno-economic energy system modelling software exist. 

The project address this by developing and testing a novel digital workflow that automatically integrates humans into scenario design while accurately modelling the relevant technical, economic and environmental constraints. With this project, we plant the seeds for locally desirable, environmentally friendly and implementable energy transition scenarios.

Decision support tools for environmental sustainability need to contend with the issue that it is individuals and the organizations they are part of that make decisions towards sustainability; this always entails trade-offs between social, economic, political, and environmental concerns. Furthermore, different individuals and organizations disagree on the importance of these different factors. Due to the urgency of the energy transition to preserve a livable global climate, realistic transition scenarios that integrate consideration of these trade-offs are needed. However, current energy-environmental modelling methods are unable to do this with sufficient speed and quality. Our long-term vision is to address this by developing novel computational approaches that include the preferences of real-world stakeholders directly in the computer models providing decision support. To do so, we combine energy and environmental scientific software development with the development and trialing of a web application that makes a "human-computer loop" possible.

In the SEEDS project a [consortium of four European institutions](/about/#partners-and-contacts) is building an approach to integrate humans into energy transition scenario design, while accurately modelling the relevant technical, economic and environmental constraints. We do this for several case studies in Portugal. The three-year project runs from March 2021 to February 2024.
