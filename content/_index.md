# SEEDS: Stakeholder-Based Environmentally-Sustainable and Economically Doable Scenarios for the Energy Transition

{{<figure src="/img/seeds_outline.png" alt="SEEDS Outline" width="600">}}

In the SEEDS project a [consortium of four European institutions](/consortium/) is building an approach to integrate humans into energy transition scenario design, while accurately modelling the relevant technical, economic and environmental constraints. We do this for several case studies in Portugal. The three-year project runs from March 2021 to February 2024.
