The SEEDS project’s modelling workflow is grounded on the key idea of generating many equally feasible energy transition options for Portugal, as opposed to a single ‘optimal solution’. This allows stakeholders to assess the trade-offs among the feasible options and discuss together what is most viable
in practice. However, the feasible options that might matter for real-world discussion are virtually infinite. For this reason, the project foresees the use of stakeholder feedback to update and improve the generated option space in the direction of stakeholder needs.

With this deliverable we design an approach that automatically uses stakeholder preferences to improve the generation of technically feasible and economically viable energy system design options. Check out all the details in the [PDF report](https://seeds-project.org/downloads/D1.3.pdf)
