An essential part of the SEEDS project is using an interactive user interface to explore the many feasible carbon-neutral energy system configurations for Portugal. 

In the first project year, Work Package 3, led by Tallinn University, conducted the necessary background research and developed an initial design concept for such an interface. 

The project deliverables 3.1 and 3.2 summarise such work. Download the [PDF report](https://seeds-project.org/downloads/background_and_initial_design_interface_D3.1_D3.2.pdf) and have a look at how things are taking shape!
